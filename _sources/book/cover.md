**About me:**
I work as a professor for Data Science and Visual Analytics at the [Düsseldorf University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hs-duesseldorf.de/). This is also where I teach students the basics of data science, Python programming, machine learning, or where I give unsolicited advice on coffee, chocolate, and all other things that really matter in life.

Until I manage to either find or build a more suitable platform, you can also find me on Mastodon: [mastodon.online/@me_datapoint](https://mastodon.online/@me_datapoint) and [GitHub](https://github.com/florian-huber).
