    "# Introduction to Working with Text Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Science is a versatile field that integrates techniques from different domains to extract meaningful information from data. Often, the data we work with is numerical, perhaps tabular and structured. However, a significant portion of the data available today is unstructured and in the form of text. This chapter focuses on why and how we work with such text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text data can be found in various forms and domains. It's ubiquitous in today's digital world and holds immense value when it comes to generating insights and making informed decisions. In general, we can categorize the applications of text data in data science into two broad categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data and Structures as Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "String data forms a large part of the information we handle in our day-to-day lives and in scientific research. It can include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **File and Folder names**: These are often encoded as text and carry essential information about the content they represent. Proper management and manipulation of these names can significantly enhance our productivity and efficiency.\n",
    "- **Categorical Data**: Many real-world datasets contain categorical features such as Pokémon type, credit card usage, eye color, etc. These categories are typically represented as text data.\n",
    "- **Names and Designations**: In various fields like social sciences, human resources, and even technical domains, names and designations (for people, products, companies, etc.) are prevalent and crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Human Language in Text Form\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of our communication today happens via written text. Such data is rich and diverse, and its analysis can provide a wealth of insights. It includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Social Media, Emails, Chats**: A substantial amount of information is exchanged through social media posts, emails, and chat conversations. Analyzing this data can help understand user behavior, sentiments, trends, and more.\n",
    "- **News and Press Releases, Print Media**: These sources provide a constant stream of new information about the world. Text analysis on such data can reveal patterns, detect events, and even predict future occurrences.\n",
    "- **The Internet**: The Internet is predominantly text, from information-dense Wikipedia articles to YouTube video tags and titles. Web scraping and text mining can help extract valuable insights from this vast reservoir of data.\n",
    "- **Protocols and Transcripts**: Transcriptions of meetings, court proceedings, and more provide a formal record of events. Analyzing these can reveal decision patterns, biases, and other organizational dynamics.\n",
    "- **Legislative Texts, Manuals**: Legal texts and manuals contain structured and vital information. Text analysis can aid in understanding, summarizing, and even automating parts of these documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections of this chapter, we will delve into how we can effectively manage and process these text data to extract valuable insights. This includes techniques from simple string manipulation to advanced natural language processing. Understanding text data and how to work with it is an invaluable skill in the modern data science landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "But let us start with the most fundamental basics: string handling!\n",
    "Here is a simple short text to work with (the text was generated by ChatGPT with its unique sense of humor...):"

You might have noticed these appearing in our story about Stringman when we printed the lowercased text using `my_text.lower()`. These are known as escape sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `\\'` sequence is used to include literal single quotes (`'`) in our text string. This is necessary because Python interprets single quotes as marking the start or end of a string. Therefore, to use a single quote as part of the string itself (for instance, in contractions like \"don't\" or to denote possession as in \"Python's\"), we 'escape' it using a backslash (`\\`) before the quote.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, `\\n` is a newline character that is used to start a new line. Python interprets this sequence as a single character that moves the cursor to the next line. This is why we see the text broken into multiple lines when we print the content of `my_text`.\n",

    "Regular Expressions, often shortened to \"regex,\" are a powerful tool for working with text data. They're a sequence of characters forming a search pattern, primarily used for pattern matching with strings or string manipulation. In the world of Data Science, regular expressions find widespread use in text processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Regular Expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "At their core, regular expressions are a means to describe patterns within strings. They offer a flexible and concise way to identify strings of text such as particular words, patterns of characters, or a combination of these. This can be as simple as searching for a specific word or as complicated as extracting all email addresses from a text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uses of Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are used for several text processing tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Validation**: They can check if the input data follows a certain format, such as an email address or a telephone number.\n",
    "- **Search**: You can use regex to locate specific strings or substrings within a larger piece of text.\n",
    "- **Substitution**: They can be used to replace certain patterns in a string.\n",
    "- **Splitting**: Regular expressions can define the delimiter to split a larger string into a list of smaller substrings.\n",
    "- **Data Extraction**: They are often used to scrape web data, where specific patterns need to be extracted from HTML code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros and Cons of Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Versatile**: Regular expressions can handle a multitude of string matching problems with concise expressions.\n",
    "- **Portable**: The principles of regular expressions can be applied across many programming languages, command-line tools (like `grep`, `sed`, `awk`), databases, etc.\n",
    "- **Powerful**: Regular expressions can match complex patterns and perform sophisticated string manipulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complexity**: Regular expressions can become complex and hard to understand and maintain, especially for intricate patterns.\n",
    "- **Readability**: A complicated regular expression can be quite cryptic, and lack of standardization in regex flavors can cause compatibility issues.\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Depending on the complexity, regular expressions might not be the most efficient way to perform string operations, especially for very large text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Regular Expressions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's built-in `re` module allows us to use regular expressions ([see documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)). The module provides several functions, including `match()`, `search()`, `findall()`, `split()`, `sub()`, and others, each designed to manipulate strings in different ways."

    "- `.` any character except \"new line\" (\"\\n\")\n",
    "- `\\d` a digit, that is 1, 2, ... 9\n",
    "- `\\D` no digit, i.e., any character except 1, 2, ... 9\n",
    "- `\\w` a word character, which includes lower + upper case letters, digits, and underscore\n",
    "- `\\W` no word character\n",
    "- `\\s` a space or tab character\n",
    "- `\\S` no space or tab character, almost all characters\n",
    "- `[aAbBcC]` any of the contained characters\n",
    "- `[^aAbBcC]` NONE of the contained characters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Positions in the String\n",
    "\n",
    "- `^` beginning of the string\n",
    "- `$` end of the string\n",
    "- `\\b` word boundary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Repetitions\n",
    "\n",
    "- `?` zero or once, i.e., the expression is optional\n",
    "- `+` at least once\n",
    "- `*` any number of times (including none)\n",
    "- `{n}` exactly n times\n",
    "- `{min,max}` at least min times and at most max times\n",
    "- `{min,}` at least min times\n",
    "- `{,max}` at most max times\n",
