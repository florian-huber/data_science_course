    "# NLP - Basic Techniques to Analyze Text Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an interdisciplinary field between computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics that deals with the interaction between computers and humans using natural language ({numref}`fig_nlp_venn`). It allows computers to read, understand, interpret, and derive meaning from human languages in a valuable and structured manner. NLP aims at building computational models of human language understanding for the development of various practical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../images/fig_nlp_venn.png\n",
    ":name: fig_nlp_venn\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, again a Venn diagram. This time to illustrate that NLP is a highly interdisciplinary field with roots in computer science, AI, but also linguistics.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of NLP in data science cannot be overstated. As we generate vast amounts of data in textual form each day, from social media posts and product reviews to emails and support tickets, NLP provides the tools and techniques necessary to make sense of this data. By transforming unstructured text into structured data, NLP allows us to analyze and extract insights from human language, providing valuable context to support decision-making processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is a very large and active field. Here we will only cover a few basics to make the first steps towards applying modern NLP techniques in data science workflows."

    "## Example areas for the use of NLP techniques\n",
    "Just to get an idea of how broad as well as how relevant NLP is, here some of the most common applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Text Classification**: This NLP application is tasked with assigning predefined categories or tags to text. With its automatic text analysis capabilities, it streamlines the process of organizing and categorizing text, proving essential for tasks such as spam detection, content filtering, and topic labeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sentiment Analysis**: employs NLP to identify and quantify subjective information within a text. This technique measures the sentiment or emotional tone behind words, for instance to help businesses understand customer sentiments towards products, services, or brand topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Summarization and Topic Modeling**: These techniques involve distilling large volumes of text into concise summaries or extracting the main topics from a document or a collection of documents. By automatically identifying key points and themes, these applications can make a large corpus of text more accessible and digestible.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Spell Checking**: This is a commonly used application that proofreads text for spelling errors. By comparing words against a dictionary of correctly spelled words, spell checking tools can suggest corrections, thus enhancing the clarity and credibility of the written text.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Machine Translation**: This complex NLP task involves translating text from one language to another. With the ability to handle vast amounts of information, machine translation systems can greatly expedite multilingual communication and overcome language barriers. This technology is, for instance, used to handle large volumes of information that would be impractical to translate manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Chatbots**: NLP plays a pivotal role in the functioning of chatbots, enabling them to understand human language, interpret user queries, and respond in a conversational manner. By leveraging NLP, chatbots can deliver customer service, provide information, and even entertain, all in real time. As every reader will know, this field has seen several breakthroughs in recent years."

    "## Python NLP libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several Python libraries that are popularly used for modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Here are a few of the most commonly used ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: This is a widely used library for symbolic and statistical NLP. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources, such as WordNet. NLTK also includes text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning. It's excellent for teaching and working with the basics of NLP.\n",
    "2. **SpaCy**: This library is known for its advanced NLP capabilities and efficient performance. SpaCy is designed to handle large volumes of text, and its features include named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and sentence segmentation. Its flexibility and speed make it ideal for production-grade NLP tasks {cite}`vasiliev2020natural`.\n",
    "3. **Gensim**: This is a robust open-source vector space modeling and topic modeling toolkit. Gensim is designed to handle large text collections using data streaming and incremental algorithms, which is different from most other scientific software packages that only target batch and in-memory processing. It's especially good for tasks that involve topic modeling and document similarity analysis.\n",
    "4. **TextBlob**: This library simplifies text processing tasks by providing a consistent API for diving into common NLP tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, and more. TextBlob is very beginner-friendly and is an excellent choice for basic NLP tasks and for people getting started with NLP in Python.\n",
    "5. **Transformers (by Hugging Face)**: This library is based on the transformer architecture (like BERT, GPT, RoBERTa, XLM, etc) and has pre-trained models for many NLP tasks. It offers simple, yet powerful, APIs for performing tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, translation, summarization, and more. It is a go-to library for state-of-the-art NLP (but clearly beyond the NLP basics that we will cover here).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will work with **SpaCy** and **NLTK**."

    "## Tokenization, Stemming, Lemmatization\n",
    "Before we dive into any complex operations with text data, we must first prepare it by dividing it into smaller, more manageable units. Similar to how we break down a paragraph into sentences and sentences into words when reading, we apply the same concept in Natural Language Processing (NLP) - but in a slightly different manner. This process is called tokenization.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tokenization**: This is the first step in many NLP  pipelines. Tokenization is the process of breaking up the original raw  text into smaller pieces, known as tokens. These tokens help us  understand the context in which they're used and draw meaning from them. Tokens are often words, but they can also be phrases, sentences, or  other units, depending on the level of detail needed. For example, the  sentence \"This is an example sentence\" would be tokenized into ['This',  'is', 'an', 'example', 'sentence'].\n",
    "\n",
    "Following tokenization, the resulting tokens often need to be normalized, a process that refines these tokens to improve their usefulness in further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Token Normalization**: Token normalization is a process that includes converting all text to the same case (usually lower), removing punctuation, and similar tasks. The process involves two major techniques: stemming and lemmatization.\n",
    "   - **Stemming**: Stemming is the method of reducing inflected or derived words to their base or root form. For example, \"running\", \"runs\", and \"ran\" are all variations of the word \"run\", so stemming reduces them all to \"run\". However, stemming can sometimes be too crude, often cutting off the end of words in a way that leaves a base that isn't a real word. For example, \"argument\" might be stemmed to \"argu.\"\n",
    "   - **Lemmatization**: Lemmatization, on the other hand, is a more sophisticated process. While it has the same goal as stemming—to reduce a word to its base form—it uses a detailed lexicon and morphological analysis of words to achieve this. For example, lemmatization correctly identifies that the lemma for \"better\" is \"good\". While it is more accurate than stemming, it is also more computationally intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization, followed by token normalization, forms the initial preprocessing steps for most NLP tasks. They transform raw text data into a more digestible and analyzable format, preparing the ground for more advanced NLP techniques."

    "## Chapter Summary and Outlook\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this chapter, we delved into the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP), exploring several key techniques for handling and processing text data effectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cleaning:** This is often the first step in processing text data, involving tasks like removing URLs, Emojis, and special characters, or replacing unwanted line breaks (`\"\\n\"`).\n",
    "- **Tokenization:** This involves breaking down text into smaller parts called tokens. Tokens can be as small as individual words or can even correspond to sentences or paragraphs, depending on the level of analysis required.\n",
    "- **Stemming:** Words can appear in different forms depending on gender, number, person, tense, and so on. Stemming involves reducing these words to their root or stem form. For example, the word \"finding\" could be stemmed to \"find\". This process is heuristic and sometimes may lead to non-meaningful stems.\n",
    "- **Lemmatization:** Similar to stemming, lemmatization aims to reduce words to their base form, but with a more sophisticated approach that takes vocabulary and morphological analysis into account. Lemmatization ensures that only the inflectional endings are removed, thus isolating the canonical form of a word known as a lemma. For example, \"found\" would be lemmatized to \"find\".\n",
    "- **Other Operations:** These could include removing numbers, punctuation marks, symbols, and stop words (commonly used words like \"and\", \"the\", \"a\", etc.), as well as converting text to lowercase for uniformity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've also discussed the application of these concepts using powerful Python libraries like NLTK and SpaCy, which provide intuitive and efficient tools for dealing with NLP tasks."
